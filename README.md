# Taco-Bell-Alert

This is my first Go project and a way for me to learn the language.

The program will check if the Taco Bell "new items" page has been changed.  Then, it will alert me.  This may be through a Slackbot, a Discord bot, or via SMS.  I am making this because of the pain I felt realizing that the Nacho fries were gone only after entering the store and trying to order them.
